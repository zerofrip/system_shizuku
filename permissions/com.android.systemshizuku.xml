  This file should be installed to /system/etc/permissions/ via Android.bp
  (see prebuilt_etc "com.android.systemshizuku.xml").

  Alternatively, if your ROM build requires the permission to exist before
  this APK is compiled (e.g. Settings depends on it at compile time), add
  the <permission> declaration directly to:

      Protection level: signatureOrSystem (signature|privileged).
      This means only apps signed with the platform certificate OR apps
      pre-installed as privileged apps in /system/priv-app (with an
